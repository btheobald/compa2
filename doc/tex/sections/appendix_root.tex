\subsection{Dialogue}
\paragraph{}
I had several brief conversations with my teacher that were not documented during pre-planning stages of the project, these conversations consisted of outlining the idea for a teaching tool that could simulate a scenario set-up by a teacher in order to accurately demonstrate the fundamentals of circular and orbital motion, as a physics student I already have some understanding of what would be required from a project like this.
