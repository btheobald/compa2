! Misplaced \noalign.

l.42 \hline
           
I expect to see \noalign only after the \cr of
an alignment. Proceed, and I'll ignore this case.

! You can't use `\hrule' here except with leaders.
\hline ->\noalign {\ifnum 0=`}\fi \hrule

l.42 \hline
           
To put a horizontal rule in an hbox or an alignment,
you should use \leaders or \hrulefill (see The TeXbook).

Missing character: There is no h in font nullfont!
Missing character: There is no e in font nullfont!
Missing character: There is no i in font nullfont!

                   \futurelet 
l.42 \hline
           
A number should have been here; I inserted `0'.
(If you can't figure out why I needed to see a number,
look up `weird error' in the index to The TeXbook.)

! Illegal unit of measure (pt inserted).

Dimensions can be in units of em, ex, in, pt, pc,
cm, mm, dd, cc, nd, nc, bp, or sp; but yours is a new one!
I'll assume that you meant to say pt, for printer's points.
To recover gracefully from this error, it's best to
delete the erroneous units; e.g., type `2' to delete
two letters. (See Chapter 27 of The TeXbook.)
