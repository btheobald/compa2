Computing A2 Coursework (2015-16)

This project is a basic n-body simulator programmed from scratch in C++ using features such as Multithreading and OpenGL Graphics, it is being developed for one of the Physics teachers at my current school in order to aid in the teaching of orbital mechanics.

This repository also contains various test programs and prototypes for proving that the simulation method is correct and that the various systems operate as intended.
