\paragraph{Force Calculation Between Two Bodies (S.1)}
This equation can be used to calculate the gravitational force exerted by two masses on x and y components without the need to use the trigonometric functions.

$$\begin{bmatrix} F_x \\ F_y \end{bmatrix} = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^3} \begin{bmatrix} r_x \\ r_y \end{bmatrix}$$

Required Parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gravitational Constant. ($G$)
\item Mass of body 1. ($M_1$)
\item Mass of body 2. ($M_2$)
\item Distance between bodies. ($r$)
\item Distance between bodies on component axis. ($r_x$ or $r_y$) (Must retain correct sign)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Calculation of all Forces (S.2)}
In order to simulate the interaction of multiple bodies, all relationships between bodies must be calculated, this can be presented as an undirected graph in an abstract sense. This also means that it can be represented as a matrix. 

\paragraph{}
When showing this organisation structure as a matrix, it becomes clear as to how many calculations need to be done in order to calculate all the required relationships.

\paragraph{}
Because the 'graph' is undirected, the matrix would be mirrored, the same force applies to both bodies in a relationship.
In order to reduce wasted memory footprint and increase ease of passing the variable, the x and y forces can be packed into the same matrix. (Will require slightly more complex programming when accessing the forces.)

\paragraph{}
Sign of the force must be retained, meaning that the way round that the force is calculated must be constant throughout all (x to y).
The number of individual calculations that need to be done becomes $\frac{1}{2}n^2-n$, this is still $O(n^2)$ time complexity. \\\
